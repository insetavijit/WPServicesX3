Below is the **final, clean, canonical nested list**.  
It is **prompt-ready**, **doctrine-ready**, and **sufficient to recreate the full document** you validated.

No redundancy. No commentary. No examples.

### **How to Approach — Page Structure & Navigation Setup**

- **Objective**
    
    - Explain what this step is meant to achieve
        
    - State the clarity it must create for a first-time user
        
- **Problem Definition**
    
    - Describe the navigation and orientation problem being solved
        
    - Explain the consequences of getting this wrong
        
- **Approach**
    
    - State the guiding principles
        
    - Enforce minimalism
        
    - Require one clear intent per page
        
    - Prefer flat, non-hierarchical structure
        
    - Prioritize first-time user comprehension
        
- **Method**
    
    - **Identify**
        
        - Determine required pages or entities
            
    - **Create**
        
        - Establish each approved page as a top-level entity
            
    - **Configure**
        
        - Set up a single primary navigation path with clear labels
            
    - **Verify**
        
        - Confirm reachability, consistency, and link integrity
            
- **Constraints**
    
    - Exclude visual styling and content optimization
        
    - Exclude secondary navigation layers
        
    - Exclude unapproved or implied pages
        
- **Completion Criterion**
    
    - All approved pages are reachable in one interaction
        
    - Navigation works without explanation

**S02 Execution Steps (Mentor View)**
    
    - Provide a concise steps table
        
    - Use short, action-oriented step names
        
    - Include mentor-style guidance on what to do and what to avoid
        
- **Practitioner Experience**
    
    - Share a brief real-world account
        
    - Highlight assumptions removed and decisions made early
        
    - Note mistakes deliberately avoided
        
- **Success Definition**
    
    - Define success as user orientation without effort
        
    - End with a mentor’s closing rule on when to stop

This is your **final structure**.  
It can now be reused as:

- A system prompt
    
- A documentation template
    
- A training framework
    
- A consulting doctrine
    

If you want, next we can **lock this as S01** and start **S02** in the same style.
