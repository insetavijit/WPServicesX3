#### **What**

Execute **Milestone 3** to make customer inquiry paths operational.  
This milestone enables **direct contact only** and does not introduce any selling, tracking, or automation behavior.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Execution Sequence**
    
    Tasks must be executed **strictly in the following order**:
    
    1. [[Configure a WhatsApp click-to-chat entry point using the official WhatsApp deep-link format]].
        
        - Use the approved business phone number.
            
        - Do not include prefilled sales scripts, automation, or conditional logic.
            
    2. Place the WhatsApp entry point in approved locations only:
        
        - Primary header or prominent CTA area
            
        - Contact page
            
    3. Install a **free** contact form plugin.
        
        - No paid upgrades
            
        - No external CRM or automation integrations
            
    4. Create a single contact form with:
        
        - Name
            
        - Phone or Email
            
        - Message field
            
    5. Configure form submission delivery to the approved inbox.
        
    6. Submit a test form entry and verify successful message receipt.
        
    
    No additional CTAs, lead magnets, popups, or tracking pixels may be introduced.
    
- **Quality Standards**
    
    Milestone 3 is complete only when:
    
    - WhatsApp link opens a chat with the correct number on mobile devices.
        
    - Contact form submits without error.
        
    - Test message is successfully received in the target inbox.
        
    - No spam filters, captchas, or conditional routing interfere with basic delivery.
        
    
    If inquiry cannot be completed by a first-time mobile user, the milestone fails.
    
- **Change Handling**
    
    - No changes to form fields, submission logic, or messaging are allowed once verified.
        
    - Any enhancement (automation, validation rules, analytics) is explicitly out of scope.
        
    - Deviations require formal approval before execution.

#### **Reference**

- **Execution SOPs**
    
    - WhatsApp integration must use static links only.
        
    - Contact form must use default submission handling.
        
    - No SMTP, third-party mail services, or delivery optimizations unless explicitly approved.
        
- **Quality Benchmarks**
    
    - WhatsApp CTA functions on Android and iOS browsers.
        
    - Contact form confirmation message displays correctly.
        
    - No visible errors, warnings, or debug output appear on submission.
        
- **Change Control Rules**
    
    - Any modification to inquiry flow must:
        
        - Reference the frozen success condition
            
        - Be approved prior to execution
            
        - Be logged and traceable
            
    
    Unauthorized changes invalidate Milestone 3 and require rollback.

**Execution Status Gate:**  
Progression to **Milestone 4: Showcase and Compliance Complete** is permitted **only after WhatsApp and contact form inquiries are verified end-to-end and formally accepted**.

If you want, I will continue with **Milestone 4** next.
