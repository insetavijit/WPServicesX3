## Objective

The objective of this document is to provide exact execution instructions for configuring a WhatsApp click-to-chat entry point in WordPress using the official WhatsApp deep-link format. The document enables an entry-level operator to complete the task without interpretation or decision-making and serves as a standalone SOP.

## Scope

This execution applies only to adding a WhatsApp click-to-chat link using the approved business phone number. The link may appear only in the primary header or approved call-to-action area and on the Contact page. No prefilled messages, scripts, automation, widgets, tracking, or conditional logic are permitted. No other site elements may be changed.

## Execution

Log in to the WordPress admin panel and wait for the dashboard to load. Prepare the WhatsApp deep-link in the format [https://wa.me/](https://wa.me/) followed by the approved business phone number in international format with no spaces or symbols. Return to the admin panel and open the header editing location used by the site, such as Appearance and Menus or the header editing interface. Add or edit a single link or button in the approved header or call-to-action area, enter the WhatsApp deep-link as the URL, enter a clear label such as WhatsApp or Chat on WhatsApp, and save the change.

Open Pages, edit the page titled Contact, and add or edit a single link or button in the approved contact action area. Enter the same WhatsApp deep-link as the URL, enter the same clear label, and update the page. Open the site in a new browser tab and click both WhatsApp links to verify that WhatsApp or WhatsApp Web opens with the correct business number and no prefilled message.

## Stop Rule

Execution ends immediately after both WhatsApp links are visible and verified as functional in the approved header or call-to-action area and on the Contact page. No further actions are permitted beyond this point.

## Completion Criteria

The task is complete only when the official WhatsApp deep-link using the approved business phone number is present in the approved header or call-to-action area and on the Contact page, and both links open WhatsApp with the correct number and no prefilled content. If any condition is not met, the task is incomplete.
