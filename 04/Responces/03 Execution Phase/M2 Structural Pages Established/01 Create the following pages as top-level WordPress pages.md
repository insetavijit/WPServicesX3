## Objective

The objective of this document is to provide exact execution instructions for creating specific top-level pages in WordPress. The instructions enable an entry-level operator to complete the task without interpretation, assumptions, or decision-making. This document is intended to function as a standalone standard operating procedure.

## Scope

This execution applies only to the creation of the following WordPress pages as top-level pages: Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy. Each page must be created as an empty page and published. No text content, images, blocks, layouts, templates, menus, settings, or page attributes are to be added or modified. No additional pages may be created. No existing pages, posts, settings, themes, plugins, or site configurations may be changed.

## Execution

Log in to the WordPress admin panel using valid administrator credentials and wait until the dashboard is fully visible. From the left-hand admin menu, click Pages and then click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “Home”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks in the content area. If a block is visible by default, leave it empty. Click Publish, then confirm the publish action when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. From the left-hand admin menu, click Pages to return to the pages list and visually verify that the Home page appears with a Published status.

Click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “About”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks. Click Publish and confirm when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. Click Pages in the left-hand menu and verify that the About page appears with a Published status.

Click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “Collections”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks. Click Publish and confirm when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. Click Pages in the left-hand menu and verify that the Collections page appears with a Published status.

Click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “Store Location”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks. Click Publish and confirm when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. Click Pages in the left-hand menu and verify that the Store Location page appears with a Published status.

Click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “Contact”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks. Click Publish and confirm when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. Click Pages in the left-hand menu and verify that the Contact page appears with a Published status.

Click Add New. In the page title field, enter the exact title “Privacy Policy”. Do not enter any text or add any blocks. Click Publish and confirm when prompted. Wait until the page status shows Published. Click Pages in the left-hand menu and verify that the Privacy Policy page appears with a Published status.

## Stop Rule

Execution ends immediately after all six specified pages appear in the Pages list with a Published status. No further actions are permitted beyond this point. Do not open, edit, reorder, assign, link, or configure any page after this verification.

## Completion Criteria

The task is complete only when exactly six pages titled Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy are visible in the WordPress Pages list, each showing a Published status, and no other pages have been created or modified. If this condition is met, the execution is considered successful. If any page is missing, unpublished, altered, or if any extra page exists, the task is incomplete.
