Proceeding to the next approved unit of work.
#### **What**

Execute **Milestone 2** strictly after successful completion and acceptance of Milestone 1.  
This milestone establishes the **entire page structure and navigation**, without content refinement, design optimization, or feature expansion.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Execution Sequence**
    
    Tasks must be executed **in the following order only**:
    
    1. [[01 Create the following pages as top-level WordPress pages]]:
        
        - Home
            
        - About
            
        - Collections
            
        - Store Location
            
        - Contact
            
        - Privacy Policy
            
    2. Ensure each page:
        
        - Is published (not draft)
            
        - Contains placeholder structural content only (headings or empty blocks)
            
    3. [[02 Create a single primary navigation menu]].
        
    4. Add all core pages to the primary navigation in a flat structure:
        
        - No submenus
            
        - No hidden or conditional items
            
    5. Assign the primary navigation menu to the site’s main menu location.
        
    
    No styling, layout tuning, or content enhancement is permitted during this milestone.
    
- **Quality Standards**
    
    Milestone 2 is considered complete only when:
    
    - All six approved pages exist as published entities.
        
    - Each page is directly accessible via the primary navigation.
        
    - Navigation order is logical and consistent across desktop and mobile views.
        
    - No additional pages, menus, or navigation layers exist.
        
    
    Any missing page, unpublished page, or inaccessible navigation item constitutes failure.
    
- **Change Handling**
    
    - No new pages may be introduced.
        
    - No renaming, merging, or restructuring of pages is allowed.
        
    - Any deviation requires formal change approval before execution.

#### **Reference**

- **Execution SOPs**
    
    - Pages must be created using the WordPress default editor (Gutenberg or Elementor as chosen, but not both).
        
    - Only structural blocks (headings, sections, empty containers) may be used.
        
    - No media uploads, forms, maps, or third-party embeds are allowed at this stage.
        
- **Quality Benchmarks**
    
    - Visiting each menu item loads the correct page without error.
        
    - Navigation is visible and functional on mobile viewport widths.
        
    - No duplicate, orphaned, or unused pages exist in the system.
        
- **Change Control Rules**
    
    - Any requested structural modification must:
        
        - Reference the Definition Phase success condition
            
        - Be approved before execution
            
        - Be documented and traceable
            
    
    Unauthorized changes invalidate Milestone 2 and require rollback.

**Execution Status Gate:**  
Progression to **Milestone 3: Inquiry Mechanisms Operational** is permitted **only after all pages and navigation pass verification and are formally accepted**.

If you want, I will continue with **Milestone 3** next.
