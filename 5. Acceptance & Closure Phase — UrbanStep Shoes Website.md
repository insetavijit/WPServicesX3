### **What**

Formally accept the validated deliverables and close the project.  
Acceptance confirms that the website meets the frozen definition and success condition. Closure terminates execution; no further work may proceed without change control.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Acceptance Confirmation**
    
    - Accept deliverables **only** if all Validation Phase checks have passed.
        
    - Acceptance is **binary** (accepted / not accepted). Conditional acceptance is not permitted.
        
- **Closure Activities**
    
    - Finalize acceptance records.
        
    - Perform administrative handover readiness.
        
    - Lock scope and execution artifacts.
        
    - Declare project completion.
        
    
    No enhancements, refinements, or post-acceptance fixes are allowed.

### **Final Closure Statement**

The UrbanStep Shoes website project is **accepted and closed**.  
A live, mobile-first, non-ecommerce WordPress website now exists, operating as an inquiry-driven trust and discovery platform, in full compliance with the approved definition, breakdown, execution, and validation standards.

Execution stops here.

- A **mentor’s closing definition** (principle-driven)
    
- A **reusable project lifecycle template** derived from this engagement
