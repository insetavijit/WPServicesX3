| **Definition Phase** | Clarity & intent         | Is the goal, scope, and success condition unambiguous and agreed?        | Project is clearly defined and frozen    |
| **Breakdown Phase**  | Completeness & structure | Are all deliverables, milestones, and tasks fully decomposed and scoped? | Work is fully mapped and execution-ready |
| **Execution Phase**  | Correctness & discipline | Is work being performed exactly as planned and within standards?         | Deliverables are produced as specified   |
| **Validation Phase** | Conformance & quality    | Do deliverables meet all functional and quality criteria?                | Deliverables are verified pass/fail      |
| **Acceptance Phase** | Closure & accountability | Has formal approval been obtained and handover completed?                | Project is formally closed               |
### **1. Definition Phase**

- **What**  
    Formally define and freeze the project goal and success condition. Do not proceed to Breakdown until this definition is complete, validated, and agreed.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Goal statement**  
        Define a single, unambiguous sentence that states what the project will achieve. Exclude multi-objective, conditional, or interpretive language.
        
    - **Success condition**  
        Specify the exact conditions under which the project is considered complete. Exclude effort-based, time-based, or subjective measures of success.
        
    - **Inclusions and exclusions**  
        Explicitly state what is included in the project and what is not. Any item not explicitly included is considered excluded by default.
        
    - **Constraints**  
        Declare fixed constraints such as time, budget, regulatory rules, platform limitations, or client-imposed restrictions. Exclude assumptions not formally confirmed.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Business objective**  
        Identify the underlying business purpose the project exists to serve. This reference governs prioritization and trade-off decisions.
        
    - **Client brief / agreement**  
        Use the approved document defining requirements, expectations, and constraints as the authoritative source. No interpretation beyond this document is permitted.
        
    - **Success statement**  
        Record the final, agreed sentence that declares when the project is complete. This statement is immutable unless formally revised through change control.


### **2. Breakdown Phase**

- **What**  
    Decompose the _approved and frozen_ project definition into deliverables, milestones, and tasks. Do not begin this phase unless the Definition Phase is complete and validated.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Approved deliverables**  
        Include only deliverables explicitly approved in the Definition Phase and mapped to a success condition. Exclude implied, assumed, exploratory, or future-phase outputs.
        
    - **Execution boundaries**  
        Define work strictly as documented tasks and milestones. Any activity not represented in the breakdown is out of scope and must not be executed.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Deliverables list**  
        Maintain a finite and complete inventory of approved outputs. The list is considered complete only when every deliverable is traceable to at least one milestone.
        
    - **Milestone plan**  
        Define milestones as non-overlapping review checkpoints. Each milestone must aggregate one or more deliverables and must not exist without deliverable ownership.
        
    - **Task breakdown**  
        Define tasks as the smallest executable units that can be assigned to one role, estimated in effort, and verified upon completion. Tasks that fail any of these conditions must be further decomposed.
        
    - **Required expertise**  
        Identify the competencies necessary to produce the defined deliverables and execute the tasks without interpretation:
### **3. Execution Phase**

- **What**  
    Perform the approved work strictly according to the defined breakdown, sequence, and standards. Do not execute any task that has not been formally defined and approved.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute tasks only in the approved order defined by the milestone plan and task dependencies. Do not reorder, overlap, or skip tasks without formal approval.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only the predefined quality rules, specifications, and acceptance benchmarks. Exclude subjective judgment or ad hoc quality criteria.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute changes only when formally approved through change control. Do not incorporate scope, design, or requirement changes informally.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Execution SOPs**  
        Follow documented procedures governing how each task is performed. Deviation is not permitted unless explicitly authorized.
        
    - **Quality benchmarks**  
        Use measurable standards to assess correctness and completeness during execution. Work that does not meet benchmarks is incomplete.
        
    - **Change control rules**  
        Apply the defined conditions under which deviations, rework, or adjustments are allowed. All approved changes must be recorded and traceable.

### **4. Validation Phase**

- **What**  
    Verify that all executed deliverables conform to the defined functional, quality, and scope requirements. Do not proceed to acceptance until validation is complete.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Validation checks**  
        Perform only the functional, performance, and compliance checks defined in advance. Exclude exploratory testing or scope expansion during validation.
        
    - **Revision limits**  
        Permit corrections only to address validation failures within the approved scope. Do not introduce enhancements, optimizations, or new requirements.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Acceptance criteria**  
        Apply binary pass/fail conditions to each deliverable. Partial acceptance is not permitted.
        
    - **QA checklist**  
        Use the predefined inspection checklist to conduct validation. Validation activities outside this checklist are not allowed.
        
    - **Review notes**  
        Record all findings, decisions, and approved corrections. Unrecorded issues are considered unresolved.

### **5. Acceptance Phase**

- **What**  
    Obtain formal confirmation that all validated deliverables satisfy the agreed requirements and formally close the project. Do not perform further execution after acceptance.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Final approval only**  
        Limit this phase to confirmation of completion against validated deliverables. Exclude new work, refinements, or change requests.
        
    - **Closure boundary**  
        Declare the project closed upon acceptance. Any work requested after closure constitutes a new engagement.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Client sign-off**  
        Secure written confirmation that all acceptance criteria have been met. Verbal approval is insufficient.
        
    - **Handover documents**  
        Transfer all agreed files, access credentials, documentation, and usage instructions. Exclude training or support beyond what was approved.
        
    - **Closure statement**  
        Issue a formal declaration confirming project completion and closure. This statement marks the end of responsibility under the current scope.
