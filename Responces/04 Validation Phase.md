### **4. Validation Phase**

- **What**  
    Verify that all executed deliverables across **Milestones 1–4** conform exactly to the approved Definition, Breakdown, and Execution standards. Do not proceed to acceptance until validation is complete and all checks pass.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Validation checks**  
        Perform only predefined, objective validation checks mapped to each milestone and deliverable. Validation confirms correctness, completeness, and readiness for use.
        
        - Milestone 1: Platform readiness validation
            
        - Milestone 2: Store structure and presentation validation
            
        - Milestone 3: Commerce enablement validation
            
        - Milestone 4: Production readiness and hand-off validation
            
        
        Exploratory testing, enhancements, or subjective review are explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Revision limits**  
        Permit corrections **only** to address validation failures within the approved scope. Do not introduce improvements, optimizations, or new requirements during validation.

            - Operational hand-off guide is complete and usable
                
        
        Validation results are binary (pass/fail). Partial acceptance is not permitted.
        
    - **Validation records**
        
        - Record validation outcome for each deliverable
            
        - Document any failures and corrective actions
            
        - Confirm re-validation after correction
            
        
        Only fully validated deliverables may proceed to acceptance.

**Validation Phase is complete only when all acceptance criteria pass without exception.**  
If you want, next we can proceed to **Phase 5: Acceptance and Closure** or generate a **formal validation checklist for sign-off**.
