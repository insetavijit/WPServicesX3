### **Phase 2: Breakdown Phase — Executed Output (Goal-Locked Decomposition)**

- **What**
    
    - Decompose the approved and frozen project goal of building a production-ready WooCommerce e-commerce website into a finite set of deliverables, milestones, and executable tasks.
        
    - Preconditions for execution:
        
        - Definition Phase is complete
            
        - Goal statement is single-sentence and immutable
            
        - Success condition (live $1 transaction, responsive site, operational hand-off) is locked
            
- **Scope**
    
    - **Approved deliverables**
        
        - WordPress installed and baseline configured
            
        - WooCommerce installed and core settings configured
            
        - Responsive theme applied and brand-aligned
            
        - Store structure pages created (Shop, Cart, Checkout, My Account)
            
        - Product catalog created with sample products
            
        - Cart and checkout fully functional
            
        - Payment gateway operational (PayPal or Stripe)
            
        - Shipping rules configured
            
        - Tax and currency configured
            
        - Automated WooCommerce emails verified
            
        - Security hardening applied
            
        - Performance baseline optimized
            
        - Live transaction validation completed
            
        - Operational hand-off guide prepared
            
        - Exclude:
            
            - Implied or assumed outputs
                
            - Future-phase or preparatory work
                
            - Enhancements, optimizations, or non-essential features
                
            - Any deliverable not required to satisfy the success condition
                
    - **Execution boundaries**
        
        - Define the project strictly as the sum of documented deliverables, milestones, and tasks.
            
        - Enforce the rule:
            
            - Any activity not represented in this breakdown is out of scope.
                
        - Prohibit:
            
            - Exploratory configuration or plugin testing
                
            - Parallel or speculative execution
                
            - Introduction of new tasks without formal change control
                
- **Reference**
    
    - **Deliverables list**
        
        - Maintain a finite, closed list of deliverables.
            
        - Validate completeness by confirming:
            
            - Every deliverable maps to the frozen project goal
                
            - Every deliverable contributes directly to the success condition
                
            - No deliverable exists without milestone ownership
