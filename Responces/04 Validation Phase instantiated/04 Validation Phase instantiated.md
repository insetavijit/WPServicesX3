#### **What**

Verify that all executed deliverables produced during the Execution Phase **fully conform to the frozen definition, approved breakdown, and execution standards**.  
No acceptance, handover, or closure may occur until validation is complete and all checks pass.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Validation Checks**
    
    Perform **only pre-defined, objective checks** against executed deliverables:
    
    - Functional validation
        
    - Structural validation
        
    - Mobile responsiveness validation
        
    - Inquiry flow validation
        
    - Compliance presence validation
        
    
    Explicitly exclude:
    
    - Exploratory testing
        
    - Usability opinions
        
    - Design critique
        
    - Performance tuning or optimization
        
    - Feature suggestions or scope expansion
        
- **Revision Limits**
    
    - Corrections are permitted **only** when a validation check fails.
        
    - Corrections must:
        
        - Address the failure directly
            
        - Remain strictly within approved scope
            
        - Introduce no new behavior or structure
            
    
    Enhancements, refinements, or optimizations are prohibited.

#### **Reference**

- **Acceptance Criteria (Binary Only)**
    
    Each deliverable is evaluated on a **pass / fail basis**:
    
    - Pass → Conforms exactly to defined requirements
        
    - Fail → Blocks acceptance until corrected
        
    
    Partial, conditional, or “good enough” acceptance is not permitted.
    
- **QA Checklist (Authoritative)**
    
    Validation must be performed **only** using the predefined checklist below.  
    Any activity outside this list is invalid.
    
    **Platform & Access**
    
    - WordPress frontend loads without errors
        
    - Admin dashboard accessible and stable
        
    
    **Page Structure**
    
    - All approved core pages exist and are published
        
    - Pages are accessible via primary navigation
        
    
    **Mobile Readiness**
    
    - All pages render correctly on mobile screen sizes
        
    - No broken layouts or unreadable content
        
    
    **Inquiry Mechanisms**
    
    - WhatsApp click-to-chat opens correct number
        
    - Contact form submits successfully
        
    - Test message is received in the target inbox
        
    
    **Showcase & Content Scope**
    
    - Collections page is visual-only
        
    - No pricing, cart, or purchase elements exist
        
    
    **Compliance**
    
    - Privacy Policy page is published and accessible
        
    
    **System Hygiene**
    
    - No demo content or test data remains
        
    - No unauthorized plugins, pages, or features exist
        
- **Review Notes**
    
    - Every validation finding must be recorded:
        
        - Pass
            
        - Fail
            
        - Corrected and re-validated
            
    - Unrecorded issues are treated as unresolved and block acceptance.

### **Validation Gate**

The project may proceed to **Acceptance / Closure** only when:

- All checklist items pass
    
- No open failures remain
    
- No out-of-scope work has been introduced
    

If you want, the next logical artifact is:

- **Phase 5: Acceptance & Closure**
    
- Or a **single-page validation sign-off document** suitable for client approval
