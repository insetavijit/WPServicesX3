The task is straightforward: build a fully functional e-commerce website, not a mobile app or marketing campaign, and do it on WooCommerce. My aim is to start selling online immediately after hand-off, so every element from product pages to checkout must be production-ready. Scope of work • Install WordPress on my hosting and configure WooCommerce end-to-end. • Apply a clean, responsive theme, tailored to my brand colors and typography. • Create clear navigation, product, cart, and checkout pages, including guest-checkout and account creation options. • Set up at least one payment gateway (PayPal or Stripe is fine) and standard shipping rules so orders can be processed on day one. • Configure basic tax, currency, and automated email notifications. • Add a handful of sample products to demonstrate best practices I can replicate. • Harden security (SSL, reCAPTCHA, brute-force protection) and tune performance (caching, image optimization). Acceptance criteria The site loads quickly, looks good on desktop and mobile, processes a live $1 test order successfully, and I receive a brief hand-off guide explaining how to add products, manage inventory, and fulfill orders. All work must stay within WooCommerce—no Shopify, Magento, or custom frameworks—so I can handle future tweaks myself through the familiar WordPress dashboard.

## Task Definition

The task is straightforward: build a fully functional e-commerce website on **WooCommerce**. This is not a mobile app or a marketing campaign. The objective is to begin selling online immediately after hand-off, which means every component—from product pages to checkout—must be production-ready.

## Scope of Work

### Platform Setup

- Install WordPress on the provided hosting.
    
- Configure WooCommerce end-to-end.
    

### Design and Theme

- Apply a clean, responsive theme.
    
- Tailor the theme to brand colors and typography.
    

### Site Structure and Pages

- Create clear site navigation.
    
- Set up product, cart, and checkout pages.
    
- Enable guest checkout and account creation options.
    

### Payments, Shipping, and Configuration

- Set up at least one payment gateway (PayPal or Stripe).
    
- Configure standard shipping rules so orders can be processed on day one.
    
- Configure basic tax settings, currency, and automated email notifications.
    

### Product Setup

- Add a handful of sample products.
    
- Use best practices that can be replicated later.
    

### Security and Performance

- Harden security using SSL, reCAPTCHA, and brute-force protection.
    
- Tune performance with caching and image optimization.
    

## Acceptance Criteria

- The site loads quickly.
    
- The site looks good on both desktop and mobile.
    
- A live $1 test order processes successfully.
    
- A brief hand-off guide is provided explaining how to:
    
    - Add products
        
    - Manage inventory
        
    - Fulfill orders
        

## Constraints

All work must remain within **WooCommerce**. Shopify, Magento, and custom frameworks are not permitted, ensuring future changes can be handled directly through the WordPress dashboard.

- Convert it into an execution SOP
    
- Rewrite it as an acceptance checklist for QA validation
