### **1. Definition Phase**

- **What**  
    Formally define and freeze the objective and completion conditions for building a production-ready WooCommerce e-commerce website. Do not proceed to Breakdown until this definition is finalized, validated, and explicitly agreed.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Goal statement**  
        Build a fully functional, production-ready WooCommerce e-commerce website on WordPress that enables immediate online selling through completed product, cart, checkout, payment, and order processing flows.
        
    - **Success condition**  
        The project is considered complete when the website loads reliably on desktop and mobile, processes a live $1 test order successfully using an active payment gateway, sends automated order emails, and is handed over with basic operational guidance for product and order management.
        
    - **Inclusions and exclusions**  
        Included: WordPress installation, end-to-end WooCommerce configuration, responsive theme application aligned to brand identity, shop/cart/checkout pages with guest checkout and accounts, payment gateway setup (PayPal or Stripe), standard shipping rules, basic tax and currency configuration, automated emails, sample products, security hardening, and performance optimization.  
        Excluded: Mobile applications, marketing campaigns, custom frameworks, non-WooCommerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, etc.), advanced automation, third-party CRM systems, or functionality outside standard WooCommerce capabilities.
        
    - **Constraints**  
        The website must be built exclusively on WordPress using WooCommerce, operate within shared hosting limitations, rely on free or standard WooCommerce-compatible tools, and remain manageable through the WordPress dashboard without custom code dependencies.

    - **Client brief / agreement**  
        The approved scope and acceptance criteria defining a WooCommerce-only, production-ready e-commerce website for immediate selling serve as the authoritative reference. No interpretation beyond this brief is permitted.
