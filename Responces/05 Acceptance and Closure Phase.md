### **5. Acceptance and Closure Phase**

- **What**  
    Formally confirm that the project meets the approved Definition, Breakdown, Execution, and Validation requirements, and declare the project complete. No further work is permitted after acceptance except through a new, separately defined project.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Acceptance conditions**  
        Accept the project only if:
        
        - All Validation Phase checks have passed
            
        - No open defects, gaps, or conditional approvals remain
            
        - The success condition defined in the Definition Phase is fully satisfied
            
        
        Acceptance is binary. Conditional, partial, or provisional acceptance is not permitted.
        
    - **Closure boundaries**  
        Upon acceptance:
        
        - All execution activities cease
            
        - No further configuration, optimization, or refinement is allowed
            
        - Responsibility for operation transfers fully to the owner
            
- **Reference**
    
    - **Acceptance confirmation**
        
        - Confirm that:
            
            - The WooCommerce site is live and accessible
                
            - Products can be browsed, purchased, and paid for
                
            - A live $1 transaction has been successfully processed
                
            - Automated order emails are functioning
                
            - The operational hand-off guide has been delivered
                
        
        Acceptance is recorded only after explicit confirmation against these points.
        
    - **Handover record**
        
        - Acknowledge delivery of:
            
            - WordPress administrator access
                
            - WooCommerce configuration ownership
                
            - Operational hand-off documentation
                
        
        Ownership transfer is complete once these items are acknowledged.
        
    - **Closure statement**
        
        - Record the final, immutable statement:
            
            - “The WooCommerce e-commerce website project is complete, accepted, and closed. All defined objectives and success conditions have been met.”
                
        
        This statement formally ends the project lifecycle.

**Project status after this phase: CLOSED.**  
Any further work requires a new Definition Phase and a new project scope.
