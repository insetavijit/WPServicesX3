## Objective

The objective of this document is to provide exact execution instructions for creating a single primary navigation menu in WordPress, adding all existing core pages to that menu in a flat structure, and assigning the menu to the site’s main menu location. The instructions enable an entry-level operator to complete the task without interpretation, assumptions, or decisions. This document functions as a standalone standard operating procedure.

## Scope

This execution applies only to creating one navigation menu, adding the existing core pages Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy to that menu as top-level items, and assigning the menu to the site’s primary or main menu location. The menu must contain no submenus, hidden items, conditional items, or disabled links. No additional menu items may be added. No existing pages, page content, page order outside the menu, themes, widgets, plugins, settings, or other menus may be created, edited, deleted, or reassigned.

## Execution

Log in to the WordPress admin panel using valid administrator credentials and wait until the dashboard is fully visible. From the left-hand admin menu, click Appearance and then click Menus. If a menu selection screen appears, click the option to create a new menu. In the menu name field, enter a clear name for the menu, such as Primary Navigation, and click Create Menu. In the Pages panel on the left side of the screen, locate the list of existing pages. Select the checkboxes for Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy. Click Add to Menu and wait until all selected pages appear in the menu structure area.

In the menu structure area, visually verify that all added pages are aligned at the same level with no indentation. If any item appears indented, click and drag it horizontally until it aligns with the other items as a top-level item. Do not place any item under another item. Do not remove or rename any menu item. Scroll to the Menu Settings section. Locate the display location options and select the option labeled Primary Menu, Main Menu, or the equivalent primary navigation location used by the active theme. Click Save Menu and wait for the confirmation that the menu has been saved.

## Stop Rule

Execution ends immediately after the menu is saved and assigned to the primary or main menu location. No further actions are permitted beyond this point. Do not reorder items further, add new items, remove items, change locations, or modify any other menu or site setting after saving.

## Completion Criteria

The task is complete only when a single menu exists that contains exactly the pages Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy, all displayed as top-level items with no submenus, and the menu is assigned to the site’s primary or main navigation location. If the menu contains additional items, missing items, nested items, or is not assigned to the correct location, the task is incomplete.
