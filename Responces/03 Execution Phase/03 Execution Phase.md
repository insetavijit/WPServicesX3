### **3. Execution Phase**

- **What**  
    Perform the approved work Starting with **Milestone 1** strictly according to the defined breakdown, sequence, and standards. Do not execute any task that has not been formally defined and approved.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute tasks only in the approved order defined by the milestone plan and task dependencies. Do not reorder, overlap, or skip tasks without formal approval.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only the predefined quality rules, specifications, and acceptance benchmarks. Exclude subjective judgment or ad hoc quality criteria.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute changes only when formally approved through change control. Do not incorporate scope, design, or requirement changes informally.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Execution SOPs**  
        Follow documented procedures governing how each task is performed. Deviation is not permitted unless explicitly authorized.

        Apply the defined conditions under which deviations, rework, or adjustments are allowed. All approved changes must be recorded and traceable.
