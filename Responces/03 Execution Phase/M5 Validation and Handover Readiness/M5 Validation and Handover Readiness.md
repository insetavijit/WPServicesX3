#### **What**

Execute **Milestone 5** to validate the completed website against the frozen success condition and confirm readiness for client handover.  
This milestone permits **verification only**. No new work, enhancements, or refinements may be introduced.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Execution Sequence**
    
    Tasks must be executed **strictly in the following order**:
    
    1. Perform a mobile-first responsiveness check across all core pages:
        
        - Home
            
        - About
            
        - Collections
            
        - Store Location
            
        - Contact
            
        - Privacy Policy
            
    2. Verify navigation integrity:
        
        - All menu links resolve correctly
            
        - No broken or misrouted pages
            
    3. Validate inquiry mechanisms end-to-end:
        
        - WhatsApp click-to-chat opens correctly
            
        - Contact form submits and delivers messages reliably
            
    4. Verify basic SEO configuration:
        
        - Page titles present
            
        - Site indexable
            
        - No accidental no-index or maintenance settings enabled
            
    5. Confirm admin usability:
        
        - Pages are editable via the selected editor (Gutenberg or Elementor)
            
        - Media can be updated without technical intervention
            
    6. Remove any test content, placeholders, or temporary data created during execution.
        
- **Quality Standards**
    
    Milestone 5 is complete only when:
    
    - The website functions correctly on common mobile screen sizes.
        
    - All core pages are accessible and readable without layout failure.
        
    - Inquiry paths work without error or confusion.
        
    - No broken links, test messages, or draft content remain.
        
    - The admin interface is clean, usable, and understandable for non-technical users.
        
    
    Any unresolved defect blocks completion.
    
- **Change Handling**
    
    - No scope changes, design adjustments, or feature additions are allowed.
        
    - Only defect correction is permitted, and only when the defect violates an existing benchmark.
        
    - Any correction must not introduce new behavior.

#### **Reference**

- **Execution SOPs**
    
    - Validation must be performed using standard browser tools only.
        
    - No performance tuning, caching, or optimization plugins may be added at this stage.
        
    - Verification is observational and functional, not comparative or subjective.
        
- **Quality Benchmarks**
    
    - All acceptance criteria defined in the Definition Phase are met.
        
    - The site satisfies the success statement without qualification.
        
    - No unresolved issues remain open.
        
- **Change Control Rules**
    
    - Any identified issue must be:
        
        - Logged
            
        - Assessed against the frozen success condition
            
        - Resolved only if it blocks completion
            
    
    Unauthorized changes invalidate final acceptance.

### **Final Execution Gate — Project Completion**

The UrbanStep Shoes website is considered **complete and accepted** when:

- All five milestones have passed verification
    
- No out-of-scope work has been introduced
    
- The success statement defined in the Definition Phase is fully satisfied
    

At this point, **execution stops**.

If you want, the next logical artifacts we can produce are:

- **S04: Problem Definition**
    
- **S05: Mentor’s Closing Definition**
    
- A **mentor-style end-to-end execution narrative** that mirrors all five milestones exactly
