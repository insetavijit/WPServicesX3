#### **What**

Execute the UrbanStep Shoes website build beginning with **Milestone 1: Platform Baseline Ready**, strictly in accordance with the approved Breakdown Phase.  
Only tasks explicitly defined in the breakdown may be executed. No additional work, refinement, or anticipation of future phases is permitted.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Execution Sequence**
    
    Execution shall proceed **milestone by milestone**, with no overlap:
    
    **Milestone 1: Platform Baseline Ready**
    
    1. Install WordPress on the approved shared hosting environment.
        
    2. Verify successful installation by accessing the WordPress admin dashboard.
        
    3. Configure basic system settings required for operation:
        
        - Site title
            
        - Timezone
            
        - Permalink structure
            
    4. Create a single administrator account and verify login access.
        
    
    No tasks from later milestones may be initiated until Milestone 1 is fully completed and verified.
    
- **Quality Standards**
    
    The following objective benchmarks apply to Milestone 1 execution:
    
    - WordPress loads without errors on both frontend and admin URLs.
        
    - Admin login credentials function correctly.
        
    - Permalink structure supports clean URLs.
        
    - No demo content, themes, plugins, or configurations unrelated to baseline operation are introduced.
        
    
    Any task that does not meet these benchmarks is considered **incomplete**, regardless of effort expended.
    
- **Change Handling**
    
    - No changes to scope, tooling, hosting environment, or configuration are allowed during execution.
        
    - Any deviation (e.g., alternate hosting setup, additional plugins, or early configuration) must be:
        
        - Formally requested
            
        - Explicitly approved
            
        - Documented before execution

#### **Reference**

- **Execution SOPs**
    
    - WordPress must be installed using the hosting provider’s supported method (manual or installer), without custom server-level modification.
        
    - Only default WordPress core files are permitted at this stage.
        
    - No plugins or themes beyond the default installation may be activated.
        
    - Configuration is limited strictly to what is required to confirm operational readiness.
        
- **Quality Benchmarks**
    
    - Frontend page renders using the default WordPress theme.
        
    - Admin dashboard is accessible and stable.
        
    - No PHP errors, broken links, or installation warnings are present.
        
    
    Failure to meet any benchmark blocks progression to Milestone 2.
    
- **Change Control Rules**
    
    - All approved changes must be:
        
        - Logged with justification
            
        - Mapped back to the Definition Phase goal
            
        - Approved before execution
            
    
    Unauthorized changes invalidate the execution phase and require rollback.
