#### **What**

Execute **Milestone 4** to complete the product showcase and mandatory compliance pages.  
This milestone introduces **visual content and factual information only**, without commercial or transactional behavior.

---

#### **Scope**

- **Execution Sequence**
    
    Tasks must be executed **strictly in the following order**:
    
    1. Prepare approved product images for upload.
        
        - Images must represent shoe collections only.
            
        - No pricing, offers, or promotional overlays.
            
    2. Upload product images to the WordPress media library.
        
        - Use clear, descriptive file names.
            
        - Do not apply compression tools beyond defaults.
            
    3. Populate the **Collections** page with images arranged in a simple, mobile-first layout.
        
        - Visual-only presentation.
            
        - No add-to-cart, inquiry buttons, or dynamic elements.
            
    4. Populate the **Store Location** page with:
        
        - Store name
            
        - Physical address
            
        - Operating hours (if provided)
            
    5. Embed a basic map reference, if required.
        
        - Static embed only.
            
        - No tracking, directions, or API-based integrations.
            
    6. Publish the **Privacy Policy** page using a standard template.
        
        - Adjust only business-identifying details.
            
        - No legal customization beyond template scope.
            
- **Quality Standards**
    
    Milestone 4 is complete only when:
    
    - Collections page loads correctly on mobile devices.
        
    - Images are clearly visible, properly aligned, and not distorted.
        
    - No pricing, purchase, or inquiry actions are present within the showcase.
        
    - Store Location information is accurate and readable.
        
    - Privacy Policy page is published and accessible via navigation or footer.
        
    
    Any missing, misleading, or promotional content constitutes failure.
    
- **Change Handling**
    
    - No additional content types (videos, sliders, testimonials) are allowed.
        
    - No design refinement or layout experimentation is permitted.
        
    - Any requested change must be formally approved before execution.

#### **Reference**

- **Execution SOPs**
    
    - Use only native WordPress image blocks or basic layout containers.
        
    - Do not introduce galleries, carousels, or third-party widgets unless approved.
        
    - Keep layouts shallow to ensure fast mobile loading.
        
- **Quality Benchmarks**
    
    - Page load remains fast on mobile networks.
        
    - Images maintain correct aspect ratio across devices.
        
    - All compliance-related pages are reachable without friction.
        
- **Change Control Rules**
    
    - Any deviation from approved content scope requires:
        
        - Written justification
            
        - Approval prior to execution
            
        - Documentation and traceability
            
    
    Unauthorized changes invalidate Milestone 4 and require rollback.
