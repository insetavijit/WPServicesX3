### **3. Execution Phase — Milestone 4 (Production Readiness and Hand-off)**

- **What**  
    Perform only the approved execution tasks for **Milestone 4: Production Readiness and Hand-off**, strictly as defined in the Breakdown Phase. This milestone validates the site for real-world use and completes the project.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute tasks strictly in the following order, without reordering, overlap, or omission:
        
        - Complete all tasks for **Security Hardening Applied**
            
        - Complete all tasks for **Performance Baseline Optimized**
            
        - Complete all tasks for **Live Transaction Validation Completed**
            
        - Complete all tasks for **Operational Hand-off Guide Prepared**
            
        
        Project completion is prohibited until all Milestone 4 validation conditions are met and confirmed.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only objective, observable quality checks:
        
        - Site loads over HTTPS without security warnings
            
        - Basic brute-force and abuse protection is active
            
        - Pages load within acceptable limits for shared hosting
            
        - Live payment is successfully captured
            
        - Operational documentation is clear and complete
            
        
        Subjective performance tuning, advanced security hardening, or growth optimization is explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute no changes beyond the defined Milestone 4 tasks. Any deviation, additional configuration, or corrective action outside the approved task list requires formal change control approval before execution.

        - **Security Hardening Applied**
            
            - Verify SSL is active
                
            - Enable basic security protections (brute-force, login limits)
                
            - Confirm no mixed-content warnings
                
        - **Performance Baseline Optimized**
            
            - Enable caching
                
            - Optimize images
                
            - Verify improved page load behavior
                
        - **Live Transaction Validation Completed**
            
            - Execute live $1 transaction
                
            - Confirm payment capture
                
            - Confirm order status update
                
            - Confirm order email delivery
                
        - **Operational Hand-off Guide Prepared**
            
            - Document product creation process
                
            - Document order fulfillment process
                
            - Document basic site maintenance steps
                
    - **Quality benchmarks**
        
        - HTTPS active site-wide
            
        - Security protections enabled and functioning
            
        - Live transaction completes successfully
            
        - Owner can perform basic store operations using the guide
            
        
        Any benchmark not met renders Milestone 4 incomplete.
        
    - **Change control rules**
        
        - No new features or plugins may be introduced
            
        - No design or UX refinements
            
        - No scope expansion or future enhancements
            
        - Any required correction must remain within Milestone 4 scope
            
        
        All approved deviations must be recorded and traced to Milestone 4 only.

**Milestone 4 execution is complete only when all quality benchmarks are met and formally validated.**  
**The project is considered complete at this point.**
