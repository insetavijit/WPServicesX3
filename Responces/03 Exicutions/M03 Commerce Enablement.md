        Progression to the next milestone is prohibited until all Milestone 3 validation conditions are met and confirmed.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only objective, observable quality checks:
        
        - Products are visible and purchasable
            
        - Cart updates correctly when products are added or removed
            
        - Checkout completes without errors
            
        - Payment gateway connects successfully
            
        - Shipping, tax, and totals calculate correctly
            
        - Order confirmation emails are received
            
        
        Subjective pricing strategies, merchandising decisions, or marketing optimizations are explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute no changes beyond the defined Milestone 3 tasks. Any deviation, additional configuration, or corrective action outside the approved task list requires formal change control approval before execution.
