### **3. Execution Phase — Milestone 1 (Platform Readiness)**

- **What**  
    Perform only the approved execution tasks for **Milestone 1: Platform Readiness**, strictly as defined in the Breakdown Phase. Do not proceed beyond Milestone 1 or execute any task outside this milestone’s approved deliverables.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute tasks strictly in the following order, without reordering, overlap, or omission:
        
        - Complete all tasks for **WordPress Installed and Baseline Configured**
            
        - After successful verification, complete all tasks for **WooCommerce Installed and Core Settings Configured**
            
        
        Progression to the next milestone is prohibited until all Milestone 1 validation conditions are met and confirmed.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only objective, observable quality checks:
        
        - WordPress dashboard must load without errors
            
        - Administrator login must function correctly
            
        - WooCommerce setup wizard must complete successfully
            
        - No warnings, failed states, or incomplete configurations may remain
            
        
        Subjective judgments, design refinements, or performance tuning are explicitly excluded at this stage.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute no changes beyond the defined Milestone 1 tasks. Any deviation, additional configuration, or corrective action outside the approved task list requires formal change control approval before execution.

    - **Quality benchmarks**
        
        - WordPress is accessible at the admin URL
            
        - Administrator account functions correctly

        - No plugins other than WooCommerce may be installed

        - No products, pages, payments, shipping, or tax settings may be touched
            
        - Any required correction must remain within Milestone 1 scope
            
        
        All approved deviations must be recorded and traced to Milestone 1 only.

**Milestone 1 execution is complete only when all quality benchmarks are met and formally validated.**
