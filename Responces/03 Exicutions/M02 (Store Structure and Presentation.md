### **3. Execution Phase — Milestone 2 (Store Structure and Presentation)**

- **What**  
    Perform only the approved execution tasks for **Milestone 2: Store Structure and Presentation**, strictly as defined in the Breakdown Phase. Do not execute any commerce, payment, product, or transaction-related tasks during this milestone.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute tasks strictly in the following order, without reordering, overlap, or omission:
        
        - Complete all tasks for **Responsive Theme Applied and Brand-Aligned**
            
        - After successful verification, complete all tasks for **Store Structure Pages Created**
            
        
        Progression to the next milestone is prohibited until all Milestone 2 validation conditions are met and confirmed.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only objective, observable quality checks:
        
        - Theme is active and loads without errors
            
        - Site renders correctly on desktop and mobile viewports
            
        - Only brand-approved colors and typography are configured
            
        - Required store pages exist and are correctly assigned in WooCommerce
            
        
        Subjective design judgment, layout experimentation, animations, or aesthetic refinements are explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute no changes beyond the defined Milestone 2 tasks. Any deviation, additional customization, or corrective action outside the approved task list requires formal change control approval before execution.

        - Active theme is confirmed in WordPress
            
        - Site is usable on desktop and mobile screens

        - No broken links or missing page errors

        - No custom code or layout builders may be introduced
            
        - Any required correction must remain within Milestone 2 scope
            
        
        All approved deviations must be recorded and traced to Milestone 2 only.
