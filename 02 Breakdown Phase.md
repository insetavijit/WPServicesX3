Below is the **re-created Breakdown Phase written as a reusable prompt**, expressed as a **strict nested list** and aligned explicitly to **goal definition discipline**.  
This is written to **enforce decomposition without interpretation**, not to describe outcomes.

### **Prompt — Phase 2: Breakdown Phase (Goal-Locked Decomposition)**

- **What**
    
    - Decompose the **approved and frozen project goal and success statement** into a complete, finite set of deliverables, milestones, and executable tasks.
        
    - Do **not** begin this phase unless:
        
        - The Definition Phase is complete
            
        - The goal statement is single-sentence and immutable
            
        - The success condition is formally agreed and locked
            
- **Scope**
    
    - **Approved deliverables**
        
        - List **only** deliverables that:
            
            - Are explicitly included in the Definition Phase
                
            - Directly support the stated success condition
                
            - Can be objectively verified as complete
                
        - Exclude:
            
            - Implied or assumed outputs
                
            - Future-phase or preparatory work
                
            - Optimization, enhancement, or “nice-to-have” items
                
            - Any deliverable not required to satisfy the success statement
                
    - **Execution boundaries**
        
        - Define the project strictly as the **sum of its documented tasks and milestones**.
            
        - Enforce the rule:
            
            - If an activity is **not represented** in the breakdown, it is **out of scope**.
                
        - Prohibit:
            
            - Exploratory work
                
            - Parallel or speculative execution
                
            - Tasks introduced during execution without formal change control
                
- **Reference**
    
    - **Deliverables list**
        
        - Maintain a **finite, closed list** of deliverables.
            
        - Validate completeness by confirming:
            
            - Every deliverable maps to the frozen goal
                
            - Every deliverable contributes to the success condition
                
            - No deliverable exists without ownership by at least one milestone
                
    - **Milestone plan**
        
        - Define milestones as:
            
            - Non-overlapping review checkpoints
                
            - Logical groupings of one or more deliverables
                
            - Validation gates, not time-based phases
                
        - Enforce:
            
            - No milestone without deliverables
                
            - No deliverable without milestone assignment
                
    - **Task breakdown**
        
        - Decompose each deliverable into tasks that:
            
            - Represent the **smallest executable unit of work**
                
            - Can be assigned to **one role**
                
            - Can be **estimated** in effort
                
            - Can be **verified** as complete without interpretation
                
        - Require further decomposition for any task that:
            
            - Spans multiple roles
                
            - Cannot be objectively verified
                
            - Contains decision-making beyond execution
                
    - **Required expertise**
        
        - Identify the **minimum competencies** required to:
            
            - Produce each deliverable
                
            - Execute each task correctly on the first pass
                
        - Exclude:
            
            - Aspirational skills
                
            - Learning objectives
                
            - Tool exploration or experimentation

If you want, next we can:

- Convert this into a **fillable Breakdown Phase template**
    
- Instantiate it **specifically for UrbanStep Shoes**
    
- Generate a **validation checklist** that blocks execution until breakdown integrity is proven
