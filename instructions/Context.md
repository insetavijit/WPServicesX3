UrbanStep Shoes is a local footwear brand based in Kolkata, India, specializing in comfortable, durable casual shoes for men and women. The business currently operates through an offline retail store and Instagram/WhatsApp inquiries, without a formal website presence.

The objective of this project is to design and deploy a **non-ecommerce, mobile-first WordPress website** that establishes brand credibility, visually showcases shoe collections, and generates customer inquiries through WhatsApp and a contact form. Online payments and cart functionality are explicitly excluded at this stage.

The website will serve as a **trust and discovery platform**, enabling first-time, mobile users (ages 18–45) to quickly browse products, understand the brand, locate the store, and initiate contact. Core pages include Home, About, Collections (showcase only), Store Location, Contact, and Privacy Policy.

The build will prioritize **clarity, speed, responsive design, and ease of administration**, using WordPress on shared hosting with Gutenberg or Elementor and free plugins where possible. The structure will be intentionally future-ready, allowing a smooth transition to WooCommerce and online selling when the business expands.

This project represents a practical example of **local business website execution focused on inquiry-driven conversion rather than e-commerce complexity**.
