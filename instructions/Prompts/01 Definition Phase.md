    - **Success condition**

    - **Inclusions and exclusions**  
        Explicitly state what is included in the project and what is not. Any item not explicitly included is considered excluded by default.
        
    - **Constraints**  
        Declare fixed constraints such as time, budget, regulatory rules, platform limitations, or client-imposed restrictions. Exclude assumptions not formally confirmed.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Business objective**  
        Identify the underlying business purpose the project exists to serve. This reference governs prioritization and trade-off decisions.
        
    - **Client brief / agreement**  
        Use the approved document defining requirements, expectations, and constraints as the authoritative source. No interpretation beyond this document is permitted.
        
    - **Success statement**  
        Record the final, agreed sentence that declares when the project is complete. This statement is immutable unless formally revised through change control.
