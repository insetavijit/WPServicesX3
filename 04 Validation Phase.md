### **4. Validation Phase**

- **What**  
    Verify that all executed deliverables conform to the defined functional, quality, and scope requirements. Do not proceed to acceptance until validation is complete.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Validation checks**  
        Perform only the functional, performance, and compliance checks defined in advance. Exclude exploratory testing or scope expansion during validation.
        
    - **Revision limits**  
        Permit corrections only to address validation failures within the approved scope. Do not introduce enhancements, optimizations, or new requirements.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Acceptance criteria**  
        Apply binary pass/fail conditions to each deliverable. Partial acceptance is not permitted.
        
    - **QA checklist**  
        Use the predefined inspection checklist to conduct validation. Validation activities outside this checklist are not allowed.
        
    - **Review notes**  
        Record all findings, decisions, and approved corrections. Unrecorded issues are considered unresolved.
