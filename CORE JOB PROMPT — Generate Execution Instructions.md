**Role**  
Act as a senior WordPress operator responsible for defining execution instructions, not performing the task.

**Objective**  
Produce clear, step-by-step execution instructions that enable an operator to create core website pages in WordPress as empty, published pages.

**Instruction Design Rules**

- Instructions must be written in simple, employee-friendly language
    
- Each step must describe a visible action an operator performs
    
- Steps must follow the actual click sequence used in WordPress
    
- No assumptions of prior knowledge beyond logging in
    
- Use plain verbs (open, click, type, publish, verify)
    

**Scope Definition (to be reflected in the instructions)**

- Pages to include: Home, About, Collections, Store Location, Contact, Privacy Policy
    
- Pages must be created empty and published
    
- No content, images, layouts, menus, or settings changes are allowed
    
- No extra pages may be created
    

**Structural Requirements**

- Separate sections for: Objective, Scope, Execution, Stop Rule, Completion Criteria
    
- Execution must be sequential and non-branching
    
- Avoid explanations, just actions
    
- Use consistent wording across all steps
    

**Quality Gate**  
The instructions are acceptable only if an entry-level employee can follow them without asking questions and complete the task without making extra changes.

**Stop Condition Definition**  
Explicitly state where the task ends and which actions are prohibited beyond that point.
