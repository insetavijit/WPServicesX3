### **How to Approach — Page Structure and Navigation Setup (Concise, Academic Level)**

**Objective:**  
Define a clear and minimal page structure and navigation system that enables intuitive user orientation and efficient access to all core website functions.

**Approach:**  
Establish a finite set of top-level pages, each mapped to a single user intent. Configure a shallow, non-hierarchical navigation structure to minimize cognitive load and ensure direct access to all primary pages.

**Method:**

1. Identify and finalize the required pages based on business objectives.
    
2. Create each page as a distinct top-level entity within the content management system.
    
3. Configure a single primary navigation menu with standardized, descriptive labels.
    
4. Verify link integrity and navigation consistency across all pages.
    

**Constraints:**  
Exclude visual styling, content optimization, secondary navigation layers, and unapproved pages.

**Completion Criterion:**  
The structure is considered complete when all approved pages are accessible from the primary navigation within one interaction and all navigation links resolve correctly.

This approach ensures structural clarity and provides a stable foundation for subsequent content and visual implementation phases.

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identify pages**       | Select only pages that directly support business clarity, product visibility, or customer contact. |
| **Define hierarchy**     | Keep all pages at the top level with no nesting or subpages.                                       |
| **Create pages**         | Create and publish each page as a WordPress Page, not as a Post or draft.                          |
| **Configure navigation** | Build a single primary menu using clear, standard page labels.                                     |
| **Assign menu**          | Set the menu as the primary site navigation location.                                              |
| **Verify links**         | Confirm every navigation item loads the correct page without errors.                               |

### **Problem Definition — Page Structure & Navigation Setup**

The core problem addressed was **user disorientation caused by unstructured or assumption-driven website navigation**.

For a first-time visitor, most small business websites fail not because of poor visuals, but because the site does not clearly answer three immediate questions: _What is this business? What can I do here? Where should I go next?_ When these questions are not resolved within seconds, users hesitate, backtrack, or abandon the site.

In the case of the shoe shop, the risk was particularly high. The business operates offline, and the website’s role is informational and trust-building rather than transactional. Without a deliberately constrained page structure, there was a strong likelihood of unnecessary pages, redundant navigation items, or misleading e-commerce cues that would confuse users and misrepresent the business model.

The problem, therefore, was **how to design a page structure and navigation system that provides immediate orientation, minimizes cognitive load, and aligns strictly with the shop’s real operating model**, without relying on visual styling or explanatory content.

The solution required eliminating ambiguity at the structural level: limiting the number of pages, assigning each page a single intent, enforcing one primary navigation path, and ensuring all critical pages were reachable in one interaction. Only by solving this structural clarity problem could later design and content decisions be made safely and without rework.

In the last shoe shop project, I did not begin with tools or layouts.  
I began by removing assumptions.

I asked the client one question only:  
**“When someone walks past your shop, what do you want them to understand in five seconds?”**

The answer was simple:  
_We sell everyday shoes. We are local. You can visit or contact us._

That answer decided the structure before any page existed.

I wrote down four pages—no debate, no alternatives:  
**Home, Products, About, Contact.**

I did not ask whether they wanted more pages.  
More pages do not create clarity; they create hesitation.

Next, I defined hierarchy.  
I made a deliberate decision: **no nesting**.  
Every page would be a first-class page, reachable in one click.  
If a customer had to “figure out” navigation, the site had already failed.

Only after this mental model was complete did I open WordPress.

I created each page as a **Page**, not a Post.  
I published them immediately, even though the content was rough.  
Structure must be visible to be tested; drafts hide mistakes.

Then I created a single navigation menu.  
One menu, one location, no footer tricks.  
The order followed human logic, not marketing logic:  
Home → Products → About → Contact.

I resisted the urge to style.
No colors, no banners, no images yet.  
Navigation must work when the site is ugly—otherwise it does not work.

Finally, I tested it as a stranger.  
I clicked randomly.  
I asked myself: _“If I land here with zero context, do I know where to go next?”_

When the answer was always yes, I stopped.

At that point, the page structure was finished.  
Not “good enough”—**finished**.

Only then did I allow content and visuals to enter the system.

That is how page structure and navigation were done in the last shoe shop project—and that is why the rest of the build was smooth.

**Mentor’s Closing Definition — Page Structure & Navigation Setup**

The goal of page structure and navigation is **not completeness** and **not creativity**.  
The goal is **orientation**.

When this step is done correctly, a first-time visitor does not think.  
They move.

If a customer can arrive, understand the business, locate products, and find contact information **without asking where to click**, the structure has succeeded.

If anything requires explanation, the structure has failed—regardless of how good the design looks.

So the closing rule I leave with the team is this:

> **Finish structure when navigation disappears from the user’s awareness.**  
> When the site feels obvious, you are done.

That is the definition of success for this step.
