### **3. Execution Phase — Shoe Shop Website**

- **What**  
    Execute the approved shoe shop website work strictly as defined in the Breakdown Phase. Build pages, layouts, and configurations exactly as documented. Do not perform any task that is not formally defined and approved.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Execute work only in the approved order:
        
        1. [[Page structure and navigation setup]]
            
        2. [[Content block placement and messaging implementation]]
            
        3. Product image and text integration
            
        4. Responsive layout adjustments
            
        5. [[Contact form configuration and testing]]
            
        
        Do not reorder, overlap, or skip steps without formal approval.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only the predefined quality standards:
        
        - Clear business messaging above the fold
            
        - One primary CTA per page where defined
            
        - Mobile-first readability and layout
            
        - Functional links and inquiry flow
            
        
        Exclude subjective design tweaks, personal preferences, or aesthetic experimentation.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Execute changes only when formally approved.  
        Do not add pages, sections, features, or content “while building.”
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Execution SOPs**  
        Follow documented procedures for:
        
        - Creating WordPress Pages
            
        - Using Gutenberg blocks for layout
            
        - Adding and formatting images and text
            
        - Configuring contact forms
            
        
        Unauthorized deviation is not permitted.
        
    - **Quality benchmarks**  
        Use measurable checks during execution:
        
        - Pages load correctly on mobile and desktop
            
        - Content matches approved layout and messaging
            
        - Images render correctly and do not break layout
            
        - Contact form submits successfully
            
        
        Any item failing a benchmark is incomplete.
        
    - **Change control rules**  
        Apply defined rules for handling change requests.  
        All approved changes must be documented, justified, and traceable back to the Definition Phase.

### Execution mindset (important)

> **Execution is not decision-making.  
> Execution is obedience to the breakdown.**
