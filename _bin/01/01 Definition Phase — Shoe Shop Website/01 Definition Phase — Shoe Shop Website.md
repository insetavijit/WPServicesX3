### 1. How to Approach — Page Structure and Navigation Setup

- **Objective**  
    Clearly define the goal of establishing a minimal, clarity-driven page structure and navigation system focused on user orientation and access efficiency.
    
- **Approach**  
    Describe the governing philosophy: finite top-level pages, one intent per page, flat hierarchy, shallow navigation, and cognitive load reduction.
    
- **Method**  
    Present a numbered, ordered method covering:
    
    1. Identifying required pages based on business objectives
        
    2. Creating each page as a distinct top-level entity
        
    3. Configuring a single primary navigation menu with clear labels
        
    4. Verifying link integrity and navigation consistency
        
- **Constraints**  
    Explicitly exclude visual styling, content optimization, secondary navigation layers, and unapproved pages.
    
- **Completion Criterion**  
    Define completion as all approved pages being reachable within one interaction and all navigation links resolving correctly.
    

Include a short concluding sentence explaining why this step provides a stable foundation for later content and visual work.

### 2. Instruction Table (Mentor View)

Produce a concise table with:

- **Step name** (short, action-oriented)
    
- **Mentor instruction** explaining what to do and what to avoid
    

The steps must cover page identification, hierarchy definition, page creation, navigation configuration, menu assignment, and link verification.

### 3. Problem Definition — Page Structure & Navigation Setup

Explain the core problem of **user disorientation caused by assumption-driven or unstructured navigation**.

Address:

- Why first-time visitors fail to understand business purpose quickly
    
- The risks of unnecessary pages, misleading structure, and over-complex navigation
    
- The importance of alignment with the real operating model of the business

### 4. Practitioner Experience

Write a **first-person mentor-style narrative** describing how page structure and navigation were handled in a real project.

The story must include:

- Starting with assumptions removed, not tools
    
- Asking a single clarifying business question
    
- Finalizing a minimal page set
    
- Enforcing a flat hierarchy with no nesting
    
- Deferring styling and visuals
    
- Testing navigation from a stranger’s perspective
    
- Stopping once structure became obvious
    

Keep the tone reflective, decisive, and instructional.

### 5. Mentor’s Closing Definition — Page Structure & Navigation Setup

End with a strong, principle-driven closing section that:

- States that the goal is **orientation, not completeness or creativity**
    
- Explains that success means users move without thinking
    
- Declares that structure is finished when navigation disappears from user awareness
    

Include a short quoted rule that defines the stop condition.

---

### Global Requirements

- Maintain a **formal, academic, mentor-led tone**
    
- Do not include emojis or casual language
    
- Do not reference this prompt or its instructions
    
- Do not shorten or oversimplify sections
    
- Optimize for **clarity, discipline, and reusability**

If you want next, I can:

- Compress this into an **ultra-short system prompt**
    
- Split it into **S01–S05 reusable prompt blocks**
    
- Or convert it into a **fillable template** for repeated use
