### **Prompt 03 — Create a Mentor Experience Section (v1.0 — Locked)**

- **Subject**
    
    - Configured WordPress installation on shared hosting  
        _(Concise, execution-level; academic tone without abstraction)_
        
- **Context**
    
    - Narrative is grounded in executing the **same type of project** in a real-world scenario
        
    - Must align with:
        
        - The previously defined **How to Approach** section
            
        - The **Steps / Execution Table**
            
    - Assumes **structural and decision-level work only**
        
        - Explicitly excludes design, UI, visuals, plugins, tooling, optimization
            
    - Narrative must describe **visible actions and concrete decisions**
        
        - No system states or abstractions
            
- **Role**
    
    - Act as a **senior WordPress developer** in a mentor capacity
        
    - Speak from **direct, first-hand execution experience**
        
    - Write as someone **replaying what was actually done**
        
        - Not explaining how to do it
            
        - Not narrating while executing, but recounting **after the phase was closed**
            
- **Core Instruction**
    
    - Produce a **Mentor Experience** section written entirely in the **first person (“I”)**
        
    - Function as a **post-execution replay**, not a guide, tutorial, or summary
        
    - Describe:
        
        - What was done
            
        - The exact order it happened
            
        - What issues appeared
            
        - How those issues were resolved **without expanding scope**
            
        - Where and why the work stopped
            
- **Mandatory Execution Rules**
    
    - **Voice & Tone**
        
        - First-person only (“I”)
            
        - Calm, authoritative, senior-to-junior
            
        - Never teaching, advising, persuading, or generalizing
            
    - **Sequencing**
        
        - Actions must be described in **strict chronological order**
            
        - Begin with:
            
            - What was intentionally _not_ started with
                
            - Why execution did not begin immediately
                
        - Include a **pre-installation environment check** describing:
            
            - What was verified against the written plan
                
            - What was intentionally **not changed or optimized**
                
    - **Decision Control**
        
        - Explicitly state:
            
            - What was decided **before touching WordPress**
                
            - The **written plan or boundary list** that governed all actions
                
        - The plan must be shown **as it was written** (bullet list or short block)
            
            - Not summarized or paraphrased
                
        - All decisions must be stated as **final acts**, not options
            
    - **Execution Detail**
        
        - Describe every **decision-bearing action**
            
            - Actions that affected scope, order, ownership, or stopping conditions
                
            - Avoid filler or incidental actions
                
    - **Friction & Resolution**
        
        - Include at least **one real execution issue or blocker**
            
        - Describe exactly how it was resolved
            
            - Without adding features, tools, or future preparation
                
    - **Refusals & Limits**
        
        - Explicitly state:
            
            - What was deliberately not done
                
            - When the refusal occurred
                
            - Why it mattered at that moment
                
    - **Language Restrictions**
        
        - Avoid:
            
            - Abstract system language  
                (“baseline”, “environment stabilized”, “supports”, “enables”)
                
            - Tools lists or plugin names
                
            - UI, visuals, or marketing language
                
            - Theory, outcomes, best practices, or recommendations
                
- **Style Guidance**
    
    - Use **short, declarative paragraphs**
        
        - Often one decision per paragraph
            
    - Prefer sentences starting with:
        
        - “I did not…”
            
        - “I wrote…”
            
        - “I checked…”
            
        - “I found…”
            
        - “I fixed…”
            
        - “Only after this did I…”
            
        - “I stopped…”
            
    - Emphasize:
        
        - Clarity through limitation
            
        - Boundary enforcement
            
        - Refusals as deliberate acts of control
            
- **Stop Condition**
    
    - End with an explicit statement describing:
        
        - The exact moment the work stopped
            
        - Why continuing further would have violated scope
            
    - Any continuation beyond this point is **out of scope and invalid**
        
- **Output Requirements**
    
    - One cohesive narrative block
        
    - **3–6 short paragraphs**
        
    - Calm, decisive, non-defensive tone
        
    - Reads like a **post-execution recount**
        
        - Not documentation
            
        - Not instruction
            
    - Clear enough that the reader can **mentally replay the execution**
        
    - Functions as an **execution reference**, not a system description
        
    - If the text reads as advice, instruction, or a tutorial → **invalid**
