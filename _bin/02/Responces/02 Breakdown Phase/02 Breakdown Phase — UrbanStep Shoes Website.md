### **2. Breakdown Phase — UrbanStep Shoes Website**

- **What**  
    Decompose the _approved and frozen_ UrbanStep Shoes project definition into concrete deliverables, milestones, and executable tasks. This phase must not begin until the Definition Phase is formally validated and locked.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Approved deliverables**  
        Include only deliverables explicitly defined in the Definition Phase and directly tied to the stated success condition. Any deliverable not named or implied by the approved definition is out of scope and must be excluded.
        
    - **Execution boundaries**  
        Limit execution strictly to documented deliverables, milestones, and tasks defined in this breakdown. No exploratory work, enhancements, or future-phase preparation beyond structural readiness is permitted.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Deliverables list**  
        Maintain a finite inventory of approved outputs, including:  
        – [[Configured WordPress installation on shared hosting]]  
        – Mobile-first site structure with approved core pages  
        – Home page (brand positioning and primary CTA)  
        – About page (brand credibility and local presence)  
        – Collections pages (visual showcase only)  
        – Store Location page (map and directions)  
        – Contact page (WhatsApp CTA and contact form)  
        – Privacy Policy page  
        – WhatsApp click-to-chat integration  
        – Functional contact form with email delivery  
        – Basic on-page SEO configuration  
        – Baseline performance and responsiveness validation
        
        The list is complete only when each deliverable is traceable to at least one milestone.
        
    - **Milestone plan**  
        Define non-overlapping review checkpoints as follows:
        
        1. **Platform Readiness** — WordPress installed, configured, and accessible
            
        2. **Structural Completion** — All approved pages created and linked in navigation
            
        3. **Content & Showcase Setup** — Core content and product visuals placed
            
        4. **Inquiry Enablement** — WhatsApp and contact form fully functional
            
        5. **Validation & Handover** — Mobile testing, performance check, and admin readiness
            
        
        Each milestone exists solely to validate ownership and completion of its associated deliverables.
        
    - **Task breakdown**  
        Define tasks as the smallest verifiable execution units, including:  
        – Hosting and WordPress setup  
        – Theme selection and base configuration  
        – Page creation and hierarchy setup  
        – Navigation configuration  
        – Content placement per page intent  
        – Image optimization and upload  
        – WhatsApp CTA configuration  
        – Contact form setup and testing  
        – SEO baseline configuration  
        – Mobile responsiveness verification  
        – Performance sanity checks
        
        Tasks must be assignable to a single role, estimable in effort, and objectively verifiable upon completion.
