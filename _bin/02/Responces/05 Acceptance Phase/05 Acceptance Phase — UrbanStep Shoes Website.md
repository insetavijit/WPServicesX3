### **5. Acceptance Phase — UrbanStep Shoes Website**

- **What**  
    Obtain formal confirmation that all validated deliverables meet the agreed requirements and formally close the UrbanStep Shoes website project. No further execution or modification is permitted after acceptance.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Final approval only**  
        Restrict this phase strictly to confirmation that all deliverables have passed validation and satisfy the approved acceptance criteria. New work, refinements, or change requests are explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Closure boundary**  
        Declare the project closed immediately upon acceptance. Any request made after closure is treated as a separate engagement and requires a new definition and approval cycle.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Client sign-off**
