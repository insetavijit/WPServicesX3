### **3. Execution Phase — UrbanStep Shoes Website**

- **What**  
    Execute the UrbanStep Shoes website build strictly in accordance with the approved breakdown, milestone sequence, and defined standards. No task may be performed unless it is explicitly documented and approved in the Breakdown Phase.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Execution sequence**  
        Perform tasks only in the order established by the milestone plan and documented task dependencies. Tasks must not be reordered, parallelized, skipped, or partially executed without formal approval.
        
    - **Quality standards**  
        Apply only predefined, objective quality criteria related to functionality, responsiveness, performance, and content clarity. Subjective design preferences or ad hoc refinements are excluded from execution.
        
    - **Change handling**  
        Implement changes solely through formal change control. No scope, content, structural, or requirement modifications may be introduced informally during execution.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Execution SOPs**  
        Follow documented procedures for WordPress setup, page creation, content placement, plugin configuration, and testing. Any deviation from these procedures requires explicit authorization.
        
    - **Quality benchmarks**  
        Assess execution against measurable benchmarks, including:  
        – Mobile-first layout integrity across common screen sizes  
        – Functional WhatsApp click-to-chat behavior  
        – Successful contact form submission and email delivery  
        – Page load performance suitable for shared hosting  
        – Navigation and link correctness across all pages
        
        Any deliverable failing to meet these benchmarks is considered incomplete.
        
    - **Change control rules**  
        Apply defined conditions for approving deviations, rework, or additions. All approved changes must be documented, traceable to a decision point, and mapped back to the original project definition.
