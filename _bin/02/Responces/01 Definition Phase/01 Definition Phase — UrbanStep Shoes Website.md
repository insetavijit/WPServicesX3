### **1. Definition Phase — UrbanStep Shoes Website**

- **What**  
    Formally define and freeze the project goal and success condition for the UrbanStep Shoes website. No structural, design, or implementation work proceeds until this definition is finalized and accepted.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Goal statement**  
        Design and deploy a non-ecommerce, mobile-first WordPress website that establishes UrbanStep Shoes’ brand credibility, showcases footwear collections, and enables customer inquiries via WhatsApp and a contact form.
        
    - **Success condition**  
        The project is complete when the website is publicly accessible on shared hosting, loads reliably on mobile devices, presents all approved core pages, and allows users to initiate WhatsApp chat or submit a contact form without error.

    - **Business objective**

    - **Client brief / agreement**  
        The locked project context defining UrbanStep Shoes, its operating model, website objectives, exclusions, and technical constraints serves as the authoritative brief for this engagement.
