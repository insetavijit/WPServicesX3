### **4. Validation Phase — UrbanStep Shoes Website**

- **What**  
    Verify that all executed deliverables fully conform to the defined functional, quality, and scope requirements established in earlier phases. No acceptance or handover activities may begin until validation is completed and recorded.
    
- **Scope**
    
    - **Validation checks**  
        Perform only the predefined validation checks covering:  
        – Functional correctness of all pages and links  
        – WhatsApp click-to-chat initiation  
        – Contact form submission and email delivery  
        – Mobile responsiveness across common device widths  
        – Baseline performance suitability for shared hosting  
        – Compliance with defined inclusions and exclusions
        
        Exploratory testing, feature discovery, or scope expansion during validation is explicitly excluded.
        
    - **Revision limits**  
        Permit revisions solely to correct validation failures within the approved scope. Enhancements, refinements, or new requirements—regardless of perceived benefit—are not allowed during this phase.
        
- **Reference**
    
    - **Acceptance criteria**  
        Apply strict pass/fail conditions to each deliverable. A deliverable is either compliant or non-compliant; partial acceptance or conditional approval is not permitted.
        
    - **QA checklist**  
        Validate against a predefined inspection checklist covering structure, functionality, performance, responsiveness, and inquiry mechanisms. Validation activities outside this checklist are prohibited.
        
    - **Review notes**  
        Record all validation outcomes, defects, decisions, and approved corrections. Any issue not formally recorded is considered unresolved and blocks acceptance.
