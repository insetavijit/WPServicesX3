## **Business Discovery & Requirement Mapping — Steps | Mentor’s Advice**

| **Step**                                  | **What to Do**                                                      | **Mentor’s Advice (How to Do It Right)**                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. [[Identify the Business Core]]**     | Document what the business sells and who it sells to.               | If you can’t explain the business in one clear sentence, stop and clarify. Confusion here becomes confusion everywhere. |
| **2. Define the Primary Website Goal**    | Decide the single main action the website should drive.             | One primary goal only. Multiple goals create weak conversions and unclear design decisions.                             |
| **3. Understand the Target Audience**     | Identify who will visit the site (B2B/B2C, local/global).           | Design for real users, not for the client’s ego. Assume the visitor knows nothing.                                      |
| **4. List Core Services or Offerings**    | Break services into clear, understandable categories.               | If services need long explanations, simplify them. Visitors skim; they don’t study.                                     |
| **5. Identify Trust Requirements**        | Note what builds credibility (testimonials, certifications, years). | Trust is not optional. If nothing exists, highlight clarity, transparency, and contact access.                          |
| **6. Define Content Ownership**           | Clarify who provides text, images, and branding assets.             | Never assume content will “come later.” Missing content delays everything.                                              |
| **7. Establish Tone & Brand Personality** | Decide formal vs friendly, corporate vs local.                      | Match the audience, not personal preference. Serious businesses don’t sound casual by accident.                         |
| **8. Identify Competitors or References** | Ask for 2–3 competitor or inspiration sites.                        | Use these to understand expectations, not to copy designs.                                                              |
| **9. Confirm Technical Constraints**      | Check hosting, domain, CMS, and integrations needed.                | Technical surprises mid-project destroy timelines. Clarify early.                                                       |
| **10. Define Success Criteria**           | Agree on what “done” means for this project.                        | If success is not defined, revisions never end. Lock this before design starts.                                         |
| **11. Document Everything**               | Write a short summary of decisions and scope.                       | If it’s not written, it will be forgotten or disputed later.                                                            |
| **12. Get Explicit Confirmation**         | Share summary and get client approval.                              | Verbal agreement is not enough. Written confirmation protects both sides.                                               |
