## **Operational Definition**

This step governs the **identification and formalization of the business core** before any website design or development activity begins.

The objective is **not** to imagine future capabilities or aspirational business models.  
The objective is to **accurately reflect how the business currently operates**, how it generates revenue, and what role the website must realistically serve within that system.

For UrbanStep Shoes, this required distinguishing between **what is sold** (footwear) and **how value is actually captured** (physical retail sales and direct customer inquiries). This distinction defines the website’s functional role as a **credibility, presentation, and inquiry-enablement asset**, not an e-commerce system.

## **Validity Conditions**

Business core identification is considered **valid only if all conditions** are met:

- The **actual revenue model** is explicitly identified
    
    - Physical sales and inquiries, not online transactions
        
- The **website’s role** is defined in alignment with that model
    
    - Trust building
        
    - Product presentation
        
    - Contact and inquiry enablement
        
- The **primary target audience** is clearly articulated
    
    - Local
        
    - Mobile-first
        
    - Seeking everyday, comfortable footwear
        
- The **core offering** is separated from supporting factors
    
    - Core: casual footwear
        
    - Supporting: local presence, guidance, accessibility
        
- The business can be expressed as a **single, stable definition sentence**
    
    - Used as a reference point for all downstream decisions
        

If any of these elements are missing or speculative, the definition is **invalid**.

## **Control Enforcement**

This step must be treated as a **scope-control gate**, not a branding exercise.

Assumptions about future online sales, advanced features, or expansion models must be **explicitly excluded** unless they already exist operationally.

Failure to correctly identify the business core results in:

- Overbuilt websites
    
- Misaligned features (e.g., unnecessary e-commerce)
    
- Increased cost without business return
    

The operator must apply **reality-first thinking**:

> If this website went live today,  
> would it directly support how the business earns money right now?

If the answer is **no**, the definition must be corrected before proceeding.

## **Gate Rationale**

This gate exists to ensure that **all design, structure, and technical decisions are anchored in real business behavior**, not assumptions.

A clearly defined business core:

- Prevents unnecessary complexity
    
- Keeps scope controlled
    
- Provides a stable decision reference throughout the project lifecycle
    

This step ensures the website is **fit-for-purpose**, aligned with actual business needs, and capable of delivering value without excess.

The gate must be **passed once and referenced continuously**.
